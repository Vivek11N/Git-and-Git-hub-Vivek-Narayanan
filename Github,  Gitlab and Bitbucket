Github
GitHub is a virtual playground and a busy marketplace where code reigns supreme. Consider a large library filled with projects, each of which is a construction blueprint for software. 
These blueprints are available for download,so developers can play around with them, create amazing things, and publish them online.
Gitlab
GitLab not just as a code storage space, but an entire software development orchestra. It holds your code like sheet music, tracks changes with precision, runs tests and builds automatically like a tireless band, and even helps with bug fixes and performance checks.
All the instruments you need, from version control to deployment, are in one place, letting developers, security and operations teams collaborate seamlessly to compose software symphonies
Bitbucket
Bitbucket is a Git-powered vault for your code, not just a lockbox. It lets developers collaborate like master thieves, using branch-and-merge techniques and
pull requests to plan, refine, and share their coding exploits. Private or public, Bitbucket offers tight access control, while pipelines speed up deployment. 

All three platforms support Git repositories, allowing users to manage and collaborate on code using Git's
distributed version control system.

GitHub has a strong focus on open-source projects and is widely used for public repositories.
GitLab provides a self-hosted option, making it suitable for organizations that prefer to manage their infrastructure.
Bitbucket integrates well with other Atlassian tools, providing a comprehensive solution for project management.
