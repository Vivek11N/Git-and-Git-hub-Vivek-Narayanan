### Github
GitHub is a virtual playground and a busy marketplace where code reigns supreme. Consider a large library filled with projects, each of which is a construction blueprint for software. 
These blueprints are available for download,so developers can play around with them, create amazing things, and publish them online.
### Gitlab
GitLab not just as a code storage space, but an entire software development orchestra. It holds your code like sheet music, tracks changes with precision, runs tests and builds automatically like a tireless band, and even helps with bug fixes and performance checks.
All the instruments you need, from version control to deployment, are in one place, letting developers, security and operations teams collaborate seamlessly to compose software symphonies
