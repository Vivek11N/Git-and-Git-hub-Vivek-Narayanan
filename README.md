## Introduction
This inculde the information about GIT and GITHUB.GITHUB basic commands and other importatnt information
## Git and Git hub
**GIT** it is a distributed version control system (DVCS), which means it helps you track changes in files over time and work collaboratively on projects with other people. It's popular among developers for managing source code, but it can be used for any type of project that involves revisions and collaboration

**GITHUB**is a platform that allows developers to store and manage their code, track changes, and collaborate with others on projects. It's essentially a social network for developers where they can share code, contribute to open-source projects, and learn from each other.
## The Github flow
The GitHub flow is a lightweight workflow that allows you to experiment and collaborate on your projects easily, without the risk of losing your previous work.
### Repositories
They're essentially containers that hold your project's files, track their history, and facilitate collaboration.
### Cloning
Cloning in GitHub means creating a local copy of a remote repository on your computer. It's like downloading the entire project, including its entire history of changes, onto your machine.This makes it easier to fix issues, add or remove files, and push larger commits. You can also use the editing tool of your choice as opposed to the GitHub UI.
### Commiting and pushing
 committing and pushing constitute two fundamental actions for effectively managing code changes and facilitating collaboration. Committing refers to the process of capturing a snapshot of the current state of your local repository, while pushing entails publishing those changes to a remote repository like GitHub.so in brief committing acts as a documentation and version control mechanism, while pushing serves as a communication and collaboration too
